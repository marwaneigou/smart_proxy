# Proxy Traffic Analyzer & Malware Scanner

## Features
- Intercepts HTTP/HTTPS traffic using mitmproxy
- Detects suspicious URLs, headers, redirects, JS, and SSL issues
- Scans downloads for malware using ClamAV (pyclamd) or static patterns
- Logs and summarizes suspicious/malicious activity

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. (Optional, for malware scanning) Install ClamAV and run clamd service.

## Running the Proxy
```
mitmdump -s main.py
```
- By default, mitmproxy listens on 127.0.0.1:8080
- Configure your browser/system to use this as HTTP/HTTPS proxy

## Testing
Run the provided `test_client.py` to simulate browsing and downloads.

## Notes
- For HTTPS interception, install mitmproxy's certificate in your browser/system.
- On Windows, you may need to run mitmdump as Administrator for SSL/TLS interception.

## Advanced Features & Extensions

### Enhanced Malware Detection
- **YARA Integration:** Use `yara-python` to scan files with custom YARA rules for advanced static analysis.
- **Heuristic Analysis:** Check for suspicious file entropy, macros in Office files, or embedded scripts in PDFs.

### Improved Traffic Analysis
- **User-Agent & Referrer Inspection:** Flag suspicious/spoofed User-Agent strings and suspicious referrers.
- **Credential Leak Detection:** Scan POST requests for sensitive fields like `password`, `token`, or credit card patterns.
- **Suspicious Parameter Detection:** Flag URLs with suspicious query parameters (e.g., `cmd=`, `exec=`, `base64`).

### Reporting and Alerts
- **Web Dashboard:** Serve a local web dashboard (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) to view real-time alerts, logs, and session summaries.
- **Email/Slack Alerts:** Send alerts for high-severity findings (malware, phishing) to email or Slack.
- **Exportable Reports:** Generate HTML, PDF, or CSV reports at the end of a session.

### Automation & Usability
- **Auto-Update Threat Feeds:** Periodically fetch the latest phishing URLs or malware hashes from open threat intelligence feeds.
- **Whitelist/Blacklist:** Define safe (whitelist) or always-blocked (blacklist) domains/URLs.
- **Config File Support:** Allow configuration (ports, rules, alert settings) via YAML or JSON.

### Performance and Stability
- **Async File Scanning:** Use asyncio/threading to scan downloads without blocking proxy responses.
- **Session Persistence:** Save logs and reports even if the proxy is interrupted.

### Advanced Security Features
- **SSL/TLS Analysis:** Log SSL certificate details, flag weak ciphers, expired/self-signed certificates, or mismatched hostnames.
- **Content Injection Detection:** Detect if scripts or iframes are injected into otherwise clean pages.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Query VirusTotal or other APIs for URL/file reputation (may require API key).

### Testing & Simulation
- **Malware Simulation Mode:** Provide safe test files and URLs that trigger detection logic for demo purposes.
- **Unit/Integration Tests:** Add automated tests for modules.
